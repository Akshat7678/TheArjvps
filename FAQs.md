## 27. How to add media in custom pm permit?

Before continuing with steps let me explain it  briefly. 

logic:- look , userge itself have no such feature for now to set a media(gif,,video,image whtever) in your custom pm permit. but you can do it  via embeding your media link in any word(you may already have seen those blue text containing link in them,..just like that) of your custom pm permit. Telegram will show preview of such direct links , so user will able to see that media on telegram itself without actually opening the link.

Steps to do so-

1. reply to any video,gif,image with .telegraph via using userge. it will upload media and give you telegraph link of your media , copy that link.

2. Now,write your custom pm message.(whatever you want to write.)

3. select any word in your message(it can be any word or just even a dot at last)

4. after selecting , click three dots at your right>click create link >paste your link there. 

5. now just write `.setpmmsg` before this whole message and send it anywhere.

done, now it will show that media (via preview) along with your custom pm message. Also have a look on these [Images](https://telegra.ph/media-in-pmPermit-10-16) to get a better idea of how to do it.

You can do it  from your local storage after downloading it or before downloading also via following command -
